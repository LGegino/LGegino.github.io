          AI hasn't really posed a threat in the cyberspace due to it's set of rules and restrictions that stop it from going too far.
          Despite being restricted and bound, AI still has the ability to access alot of the contents online that may be private. 
          AI's only limitation is the access lock and rules in place to prevent it from going too far and grasping data that can fall into the wrong hands.
          Cybersecurity has not found a solid response to this threat aside from the verifications/captchas. 
          But the problem lies with the infinite learning capabilities of AI, being trained to bypass such security measures that prevent it from enacting breaches.
          The only way AI can be reliably stopped from doing damages online is through strong restrcitions by it's maker. 
          Which isn't really a solid course of action due to other users that train their AI unbounding it and turning it into something malicous that can do multiple things that can break the cyber space.
          DDOSing is a famous example where an AI can flood a site with fake user to make the site crash and become unaccesible to other users.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          AI is not the only thing in the offense here, it can also be used for defense. Unlike humans, AI responds to certain actions or things that it detects.
          Making it the perfect tool to respond, detect, and automate tasks that can go against any cyber threats that triggers it. 
          This cybersecurity AI can potentially adapt to new threats, enhance protection, reduce false positives, and simulate social engineering attacks. 
          Yes, a very capable tool that can do many things at once that may potentially be faster than a human.
          However, they will still need to be monitored for updates and cleaning in the software. 
          AI is not sentient enough to learn threats, quickly improve itself and constantly improve itself- it still needs to be managed by humans to take its place at times where it cannot defend against a threat.
