        <h2> 
          The World Wide Web is a vast setting with a lot of data to be explored.
          A place where peopl can learn and expand their knowledge outside their limited areas.
          Accessing data that isn't available at your current setting.
          But among those things that people can browse are scams, fakes, misleading things, and misinformation.
          Far worse are things that made it's way in the web that isn't for a normal persons viewing.
        </h2>  
        <h2>
          People should be more aware of the contents on the internet being only credible when published by sources that have established integrity.
          When on the web, things that are too good to be true are always too good to be true.
          Scams take advantage of people not knowledgable enough to understand that a fake alert or a great deal can lead to their data being breached.
          But how is this related to responsible consumption?
          Simply put, when you go online- you have to be prepared and be responsible enough to make the right choices when clicking on things, in order to avoid being at the risk of a breach. 
          When you see something that looks suspicious or is full of misinformation, use the web in order to verify with trusted sources.
          The web is not always and only filled with misleading things, there are a whole bunch more of information that can help you avoid falling for alot of these malicous/misinformed types of media, file or sites.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Not only is to look out for malicous things a responsibility, but to also avoid going to places that are innapropriate for you.
          There are places in the internet that offer content that may be illegal, moraly wrong, or disgusting.
          This is where you as a viewer should stop browsing once you see these things- as it can lead to potential arrests or data breaches.
          Malicous sites that offer eye candy (porn site generaly) can bait users with ads that lead to the user's data being phished. 
          But aside from personal information being taken by dark sites, the user must not make it a habit to visit these sites often.
          Developing a habit of visiting sites that display and offer illegal/moraly wrong content will cause a person to develop addictions that can ruin a persons livelyhood. 
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Simply put, it is a users responsibility to utilize the web when faced with uncertain content that may seem wrong.
          The user also needs to be using the internet for their betterment ( learning, relaxing, helping, etc...) and not to frequent sites that offer taboo, moraly wrong, disgusting and malicous content
