        <h2> In this new age of technological advances, 
            many people without the money to afford a device that can link to the internet may be troubling and can set people behind. 
            Leaving many people clueless as to what they will consume when they finally get a hold of such technology.
            People may be mislead and will take everything they see as facts due to having the lack of knowledge in areas of fake news, scams, photoshop, etc...
        
            Now if we are to take AI and people see it as an all knowing tool that you can feed questions to, then people with low literacy rate online will be mislead by the AI's inaccurate feed and replies.
            It is established that AI isn't always 100% correct, in the words of Dr. Rachel "AI lacks empathy"- which we may all be able to agree on.
            In general, the point I'm trying to drive here is that a not so well literate person of the internet may be baited into doing plenty of errors due to the clueless nature of a person entering a digital space full of misinformation, scams, fakes, and plenty more misguiding media, sites and information.
            It is comparable to a toddler entering this new world and navigating with no idea for what's in store, having to learn everything slowly and may fumble a few times due to the lack of knowledge on many of their surroundings and being weak and unable to protect itself.
