          While it is true that AI is a revolutionary product of the modern age that can give plenty of near accurate responses to queries,
          it also posseses flaws that can affect the integrity of it's outputs. The problem with AI is the limitations it currently has. 
          AI follows a strict framework from from how a human thinks and follows the request made by users too literally.
          An Example of ths is the making of peanut butter sandwiches.
          An AI will interpret putting the peanut butter on the bread as literally putting the whole jar ontop of the bread.

        Well simply because it can both provide such insights on topics a person may not be able to study well,
        or give us something else that may be inaccurate.
        AI is restricted when providing data as it scans the internet for data to use to provide answers with. 
        The problem is how the AI must only be restricted to accessing very surface level data on the web to avoid the risk of it going deeper for the query it was provided with.
        Knowing this, AI cannot open a lot of links online and files in the web unless providing via uploading to the direct AI.
        This means that AI can absolutely give you wonderful responses on very widespread topics that are generally popular in the web,
        as opposed to more nicher topics that the AI would require deep diving in the internet in order to obtain data- which is not inline with it's rules.
      </h2>
      <h2 id="AI">
        AI is such a blesssing that saves us so much time on research and formulating answers. But due to it's very limited nature, it can half bake responses due to the inability ot access certain key things in the internet that may give a better response. This in turn cuases the AI to provide inssuficient outputs.
        Due to this, the AI will be providing very generalized data that may or may not be entirely correct for it's user.
